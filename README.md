# MyBnB

Welcome to my MyBnB Project!

This is my CSCC43 Final Project.

It is a Java application that uses MySQL as its database.

Use the MySQL Database Setup Commands to setup the initial database in order for the Java application to work.

It is also important to import the Bookings.csv file into the Bookings table as there has been no prior data entry for the Bookings table.
